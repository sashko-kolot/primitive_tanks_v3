A turn-based console tactical board game for two players which is played on one computer. 
The game imitates a tank battle. Players have an equal number of units they place on the board with X and Y coordinates at the beginning of the game. 
By moving units and shooting on their turn, players try to destroy all units of the opponent and to avoid destruction of their own units.
Each player has two boards — one with their own units and marked opponent’s shots and the second reflecting the situation on the opponent’s side. 
The second board is the record of the player’s hits and misses on the opponent’s side.
The first board is used for placing the player’s units and moving them during the game.
The second board is used for shooting and other possible combat actions on the opponent’s side.
